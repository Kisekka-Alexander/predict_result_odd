## Football Match Prediction System
Overview
This project develops a machine learning system to predict football match outcomes (Win, Draw, Loss) for major European leagues (EPL, LaLiga, Bundesliga) using historical match data and betting odds. The system leverages Python-based data processing and machine learning libraries to clean data, train predictive models, and evaluate their performance.
Features

Data Collection: Aggregated and cleaned over 1,000 historical match records from EPL, LaLiga, and Bundesliga.
Data Processing: Utilizes Pandas for efficient data cleaning and preprocessing.
Predictive Models: Implements Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Random Forest classifiers to forecast match outcomes based on betting odds.
Evaluation: Employs cross-validation, confusion matrix, and classification reports to assess model performance.
Visualization: Uses Matplotlib and Seaborn for insightful data visualizations.

Technologies Used

Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
Scikit-learn: Machine learning model implementation and evaluation
Matplotlib: Data visualization
Seaborn: Enhanced data visualization
Jupyter Notebook: Interactive development and documentation


Environment: Jupyter Notebook for model development and testing

Model Details
The system evaluates multiple machine learning models to predict match outcomes based on betting odds (Home, Away, Draw). The models include:

Logistic Regression: Configured with C=10 for regularization, achieving stable performance.
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN): Tested with n_neighbors=20, but underperformed.
Random Forest: Configured with n_estimators=20, but showed poor results compared to Logistic Regression.

Example Code
Below is a snippet of the core model training and evaluation logic:
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split, cross_val_score
from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score, classification_report, confusion_matrix
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Load and preprocess data
data = pd.read_csv('data/historical_matches.csv')
X = data[['Home', 'Away', 'Draw']]
y = data['Result']

# Split data
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=190)

# Train model
model = LogisticRegression(C=10)
model.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions
test_odds = [[3.28, 3.38, 2.3]]
predictions = model.predict(X_test)
test_pred = model.predict(test_odds)

# Evaluate model
cross_val_accuracy = cross_val_score(model, X, y, cv=10, scoring='accuracy')
conf_matrix = confusion_matrix(y_test, predictions)
class_report = classification_report(y_test, predictions)

print(f'Prediction for test odds: {test_pred}')
print(f'Cross-Validation Accuracy: {cross_val_accuracy.mean()}')
print(f'Confusion Matrix:\n{conf_matrix}')
print(f'Classification Report:\n{class_report}')

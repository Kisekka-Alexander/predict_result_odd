- Multiple ML model implementations:
  - Logistic Regression
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Random Forest Classifier
- Comprehensive model evaluation metrics
- Visualization tools for performance analysis

## Dataset
The dataset contains:
- Match results (Win/Draw/Loss)
- Betting odds for:
  - Home win
  - Draw
  - Away win
